## Product Requirements Document (PRD) Overview: Account Summary View

The goal of this PRD is to provide 8x8 customers with a comprehensive and actionable account summary view that consolidates invoice data, payment history, and credit adjustments into a single, intuitive interface within the Gaviti external dashboard. This summary page is designed to enhance billing transparency, self-service capabilities, and customer satisfaction by enabling users to quickly assess their financial standing and take key actions.

### Key Capabilities:

* **Displaying total account balance** with drill-down access to open, past due, and closed invoices.
* **Highlighting account status** (e.g., Active, CC Suspended, Suspended) to give immediate visibility into billing risk or restrictions.
* **Enabling one-time payments** via credit card based on currency and payment method eligibility.
* **Providing a dispute option** directly from the summary view.
* **Linking to knowledge articles** to support self-resolution and reduce support ticket volume.

### Integration and Data Flow:

This account summary experience is tightly integrated with 8x8â€™s Billing Manager and Gaviti platforms. All invoice and customer data will be provided in the agreed format already shared with Gaviti, and updates (e.g., invoice status changes post-payment) will be reflected with a known data sync lag (up to 24 hours). Additional validations and payment eligibility rules will be enforced based on customer billing configuration (e.g., currency type, primary payment method).

### Business Impact:

This functionality not only empowers customers to manage their financial relationship with 8x8 more efficiently but also supports internal goals around collections automation, payment accuracy, and customer experience optimization.
